# IsItDone - Book Series Completion Tracker

## Project Overview

IsItDone is a modern web application designed to help readers track and discover book series. The platform allows users to check if a book series is complete, find the recommended reading order, and get personalized book recommendations based on their preferences.

## Tech Stack & Architecture

### Core Technologies

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 15+ with TypeScript
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn UI
- **State Management**: React Context API (with potential for Redux or Zustand if complexity increases)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Shadcn UI components
- **Routing**: Next.js built-in App Router
- **API Integration**: Google Books API, RESTful API calls with fetch/axios
- **Animation**: CSS transitions and Tailwind custom animations for interactive elements

### Custom Tailwind Animations

The project includes custom animations defined in the tailwind.config.ts file:

```tsx
// Custom animations in tailwind.config.ts
theme: {
  extend: {
    keyframes: {
      "fade-in": {
        "0%": { opacity: "0" },
        "100%": { opacity: "1" },
      },
      "fade-in-down": {
        "0%": { opacity: "0", transform: "translateY(-20px)" },
        "100%": { opacity: "1", transform: "translateY(0)" },
      },
      "fade-in-up": {
        "0%": { opacity: "0", transform: "translateY(20px)" },
        "100%": { opacity: "1", transform: "translateY(0)" },
      },
    },
    animation: {
      "fade-in": "fade-in 0.5s ease-out forwards",
      "fade-in-down": "fade-in-down 0.5s ease-out forwards",
      "fade-in-up": "fade-in-up 0.5s ease-out forwards",
    },
  },
}
```

These animations can be used directly in className attributes:

```tsx
<div className="animate-fade-in">Fades in</div>
<div className="animate-fade-in-down">Fades in from top</div>
<div className="animate-fade-in-up">Fades in from bottom</div>
```

For delayed animations, use inline styles:

```tsx
<div className="animate-fade-in" style={{ animationDelay: "0.3s" }}>
	Delayed fade in
</div>
```

### Layout and Styling Approach

The project uses a consistent layout approach across all pages:

1. **Full-width backgrounds with centered content**:
   - Each section has `w-full` to ensure backgrounds span the entire screen width
   - Content is centered using `mx-auto max-w-7xl px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`
   - This creates visually appealing layouts with edge-to-edge backgrounds and properly constrained content

Example section structure:

```tsx
<section className="py-20 bg-muted/30 w-full">
	<div className="mx-auto max-w-7xl px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
		{/* Section content */}
	</div>
</section>
```

This approach allows for:

- Full-width colored backgrounds that extend edge-to-edge
- Centered content with a maximum width (1280px)
- Responsive padding that increases at larger screen sizes:
  - 16px on mobile (px-4)
  - 24px on small screens (sm:px-6)
  - 32px on large screens (lg:px-8)

### Adding Shadcn UI Components

To add a new Shadcn UI component to the project, run:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add component-name
```

For example, to add the button component:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

This will add the component to your project's components/ui directory, which you can then import and use in your application.

### Component Architecture

The application follows Next.js 15+ architecture with a mix of server and client components:

#### Server Components

Server components render on the server and send HTML to the client, reducing JavaScript bundle size:

- `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx` - Static footer with links
- `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx` - Static features display with animations
- `src/components/home/PopularSeriesSection.tsx` - Static series showcase
- `src/components/home/CTASection.tsx` - Static call-to-action section

#### Client Components

Client components include interactivity and are marked with `"use client"` directive:

- All Shadcn UI components (`src/components/ui/*`)
- `src/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx` - Manages theme state
- `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` - Contains navigation and mobile menu state
- `src/components/search/*` - Search functionality with form state
- `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx` - Contains SearchBar component

This architecture optimizes for both performance and interactivity by rendering static content on the server while maintaining client-side interactivity where needed.

			className={`book-node transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out ${
				isActive ? "scale-105 shadow-lg" : "scale-100"
			}`}
			onClick={onClick}
		>
			<img
				src={book.coverUrl}
				alt={book.title}
				className="transition-transform duration-300"
			/>
			<h3>{book.title}</h3>
			{isActive && (
				<div className="book-details transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out opacity-100 h-auto">
					{/* Book details */}
				</div>
			)}
		</div>
	);
};
```

## Client vs Server Components

### Current Client Components

The following components are currently marked with `"use client"` directive:

#### UI Components (Shadcn)

These components need to remain as client components because they use client-side interactivity, state, or browser APIs:

- `src/components/ui/select.tsx` - Uses Radix UI's interactive select component
- `src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx` - Uses client-side interactivity for dropdown functionality
- `src/components/ui/checkbox.tsx` - Manages checkbox state on the client
- `src/components/ui/radio-group.tsx` - Manages radio button state on the client
- `src/components/ui/label.tsx` - Often paired with interactive form elements

#### Providers

These components need to remain as client components because they provide context to the client-side React tree:

- `src/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx` - Uses next-themes to manage theme state on the client

#### Search Components

These components use client-side state, event handlers, and browser APIs:

- `src/components/search/SearchBar.tsx` - Uses form state, event handlers, and navigation
- `src/components/search/SearchResults.tsx` - Likely manages search result state
- `src/components/search/BookCard.tsx` - May contain interactive elements or client-side state

#### Layout Components

These components may use client-side interactivity for navigation, theme switching, etc.:

- `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` - Likely contains navigation and theme toggle
- `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx` - May contain interactive elements

#### Home Page Components

These components may use animations, state, or other client-side features:

- `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx` - Contains animations and the SearchBar component
- `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx` - May contain animations or interactive elements
- `src/components/home/PopularSeriesSection.tsx` - May contain client-side state or interactivity
- `src/components/home/CTASection.tsx` - May contain interactive elements or animations

#### Page Components

- `src/app/search/page.tsx` - Uses client-side features for search functionality

### Components That Could Be Converted to Server Components

After removing HeroUI dependencies, some components might be convertible to server components if they:

1. Don't use React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
2. Don't use event handlers (onClick, onChange, etc.)
3. Don't use browser-only APIs
4. Don't use client components directly (without a client boundary)

Based on our analysis, here are specific components that could potentially be converted to server components:

1. **Footer Component** (`src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`):

   - Currently marked with "use client" but doesn't appear to use any client-side features
   - Only uses Next.js Link component and static JSX
   - The only client-side code is `new Date().getFullYear()` which could be replaced with server-side code
   - Could be converted to a server component

2. **FeaturesSection Component** (`src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`):

   - Currently marked with "use client" but contains only static JSX
   - Uses CSS animations that can work in server components
   - No state or event handlers
   - Could be converted to a server component

3. **PopularSeriesSection Component** (`src/components/home/PopularSeriesSection.tsx`):
   - Would need further examination, but if it only displays static content or server-fetched data without client interactivity, it could be converted

Components that should remain as client components:

1. **Header Component** (`src/components/layout/Header.tsx`):

   - Uses useState for mobile menu toggle
   - Contains interactive elements (dropdown menu, search input)
   - Should remain a client component

2. **HeroSection Component** (`src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`):

   - Contains the SearchBar component which is a client component
   - Should remain a client component unless SearchBar is extracted and properly wrapped

3. **SearchBar Component** (`src/components/search/SearchBar.tsx`):

   - Heavy use of state and event handlers
   - Form submission and navigation
   - Must remain a client component

4. **All Shadcn UI Components**:
   - These are built on Radix UI primitives which require client-side JavaScript
   - Must remain as client components

### Conversion Strategy

When converting a component from client to server:

1. Remove the `"use client"` directive
2. Replace any hooks with server-side data fetching
3. Move any interactive elements to separate client components
4. Ensure any client components used are properly wrapped with their own `"use client"` directive

### Using Client Components in Server Contexts

When using client-side hooks like `useSearchParams()`, `useRouter()`, or other browser-only APIs in a component that's rendered on the server:

1. **Wrap with Suspense boundaries**: Always wrap components that use client-side hooks in a `<Suspense>` boundary to ensure proper hydration and avoid build errors.

```tsx
// Example: Proper use of useSearchParams() in a page component
"use client";

import { Suspense } from "react";
import { useSearchParams } from "next/navigation";

// Client component that uses the hook
function SearchContent() {
	const searchParams = useSearchParams();
	const query = searchParams.get("q") || "";

	return <div>Search results for: {query}</div>;
}

// Page component with Suspense boundary
export default function SearchPage() {
	return (
		<div>
			<h1>Search Page</h1>
			<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading search results...</div>}>
				<SearchContent />
			</Suspense>
		</div>
	);
}
```

2. **Provide fallback UI**: Always include a meaningful fallback UI in the Suspense boundary to improve user experience during loading.

3. **Keep client components small**: Extract only the parts that need client-side functionality into separate components to minimize the JavaScript sent to the client.

### Benefits of Server Components

- Reduced client-side JavaScript
- Improved initial page load performance
- Automatic code splitting
- Server-side rendering of content
- Direct access to backend resources

### When to Keep Client Components

Keep components as client components when they:

- Manage state with React hooks
- Use event listeners
- Access browser-only APIs
- Need to be interactive
- Use client-only libraries

### Converted Components

The following components have been successfully converted from client components to server components:

1. **Footer Component** (`src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`):

   - Removed "use client" directive
   - Moved the date calculation outside the component to execute at server render time
   - No client-side functionality needed

2. **FeaturesSection Component** (`src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`):

   - Removed "use client" directive
   - Component only contains static JSX and CSS animations
   - No client-side functionality needed

3. **PopularSeriesSection Component** (`src/components/home/PopularSeriesSection.tsx`):

   - Removed "use client" directive
   - Component only contains static JSX and a Button wrapped in a Link
   - No client-side functionality needed

4. **CTASection Component** (`src/components/home/CTASection.tsx`):
   - Removed "use client" directive
   - Component only contains static JSX and a Button wrapped in a Link
   - No client-side functionality needed

### Fixed Components

The following components have been fixed to properly handle client-side functionality:

1. **Search Page** (`src/app/search/page.tsx`):
   - Restructured to properly use `useSearchParams()` with a Suspense boundary
   - Extracted the part using client-side hooks into a separate `SearchContent` component
   - Added a loading fallback UI for better user experience
   - Fixed build errors related to missing Suspense boundaries

These conversions and fixes help reduce the amount of JavaScript sent to the client, improving initial page load performance and leveraging Next.js server components effectively.
